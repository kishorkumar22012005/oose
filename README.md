# E-Ticketing System Design using ArgoUML

This project provides the complete design and modeling of an **E-Ticketing System** using the **ArgoUML** tool. It demonstrates how to use UML diagrams to plan, visualize, and structure the architecture of a real-world ticketing application.

## 🎯 Objective

To model a digital ticketing system that enables users to:
- Search and book tickets
- Make online payments
- Receive digital tickets
- Manage user and admin roles

## 🧰 Tools Used

- **ArgoUML** – An open-source UML modeling tool  
- **Java (optional)** – For implementation mapping  
- **PDF Export** – For sharing diagrams

## 📚 UML Diagrams Included

- **Use Case Diagram** – Illustrates major actors and their interactions  
- **Class Diagram** – Defines core system classes and their relationships  
- **Sequence Diagram** – Shows object interactions during ticket booking  
- **Activity Diagram** – Describes workflow of ticket purchasing  
- **State Diagram** – Captures ticket lifecycle states  
- **Deployment Diagram** – Shows system's physical deployment setup  

## 🔧 System Features Modeled

- User login & registration  
- Event/ticket search  
- Seat selection and reservation  
- Payment processing  
- Ticket generation (PDF/email)  
- Admin panel for event management
